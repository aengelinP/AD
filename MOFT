Exercise:

Multiple of Three
You are given two 
-element arrays 
 and 
, indexed from 
 to 
, that contain as values integers between 
 and 
. You are a playing a game in which you start with a pawn at index 
. If your pawn is at some point at index 
, you can move it to index 
. Your goal is to arrive at an index where 
 is a multiple of 
.

Return the number of moves that you must make to arrive at such an index, or return 
 if you can never arrive at such an index. Note that, if 
 is already a multiple of 
, the answer is 
.

For example, for 
, 
, 
, and 
, the answer is 
 (you move from index 
 to index 
 to index 
 to index 
). On the other hand, for 
, 
, 
, and 
, the answer is 
.

You need to implement your solution as a method getNumberMoves(
, 
, 
, 
) in the file Main.java. You get one point for each passing test set. To pass both test sets, your solution needs to run in time 
.

Attention: You are NOT allowed to use imports explicitly or implicitly, other than the imports already included in the code template.
